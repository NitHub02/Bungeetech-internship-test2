Question 4:- How would you rate the difficult of the assessment on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being very simple and 10 being very hard?
Do you want another assessment which more focused on Data structures and algorithms?
Please answer this question in the email itself which you are going to send to submit the link of the assessment github repo.



I will rate 8 for difficulty of the exam as both in question wise and also in the platform which the exam conducted. I think this assesment is enough no need for another assessment.
